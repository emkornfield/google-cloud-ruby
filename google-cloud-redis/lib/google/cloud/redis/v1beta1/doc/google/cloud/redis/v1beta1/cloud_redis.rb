      module V1beta1
        # A Google Cloud Redis instance.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [String]
        #     Required. Unique name of the resource in this scope including project and
        #     location using the form:
        #         `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
        #
        #     Note: Redis instances are managed and addressed at regional level so
        #     location_id here refers to a GCP region; however, users get to choose which
        #     specific zone (or collection of zones for cross-zone instances) an instance
        #     should be provisioned in. Refer to [location_id] and
        #     [alternative_location_id] fields for more details.
        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [String]
        #     An arbitrary and optional user-provided name for the instance.
        # @!attribute [rw] labels
        #   @return [Hash{String => String}]
        #     Resource labels to represent user provided metadata
        # @!attribute [rw] location_id
        #   @return [String]
        #     Optional. The zone where the instance will be provisioned. If not provided,
        #     the service will choose a zone for the instance. For STANDARD_HA tier,
        #     instances will be created across two zones for protection against zonal
        #     failures. if [alternative_location_id] is also provided, it must be
        #     different from [location_id].
        # @!attribute [rw] alternative_location_id
        #   @return [String]
        #     Optional. Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance
        #     against zonal failures by provisioning it across two zones. If provided, it
        #     must be a different zone from the one provided in [location_id].
        # @!attribute [rw] redis_version
        #   @return [String]

        #     If not provided, latest supported version will be used.
        # @!attribute [rw] reserved_ip_range
        #   @return [String]
        #     Optional. The CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this
        #     instance. If not provided, the service will choose an unused /29 block,
        #     for example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/29. Ranges must be unique
        #     and non-overlapping with existing subnets in a network.
        # @!attribute [rw] host
        #   @return [String]

        #   @return [Integer]
        #     Output only. The port number of the exposed redis endpoint.
        # @!attribute [rw] current_location_id
        #   @return [String]
        #     Output only. The current zone where the Redis endpoint is placed. In
        #     single zone deployments, this will always be the same as [location_id]
        #     provided by the user at creation time. In cross-zone instances (only
        #     applicable in STANDARD_HA tier), this can be either [location_id] or
        #     [alternative_location_id] and can change on a failover event.
        # @!attribute [rw] create_time
        #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     Output only. The time the instance was created.
